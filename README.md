# OpenGL playground
This is a project for me to mess around with OpenGL.
I'm developing this on Ubuntu 20.04, so although it should
be cross-platform because of the libraries and APIs I'm using, I don't know
how to get everything to compile on any other operating system.

# The stack I'm using
- OpenGL
- GLFW3
- GLEW
- GLM
